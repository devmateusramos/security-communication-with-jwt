# Security Communication with JWT

This project aims to provide a secure communication solution using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Golang. It leverages the cryptographic capabilities of the ed25519 algorithm to ensure robust authentication and data integrity within communication chains. JWTs offer a standardized and efficient means of securely transmitting information between parties, making them suitable for various authentication and authorization scenarios.

## Features

- Implementation of JWT-based authentication mechanism
- Utilization of ed25519 for cryptographic operations
- Secure communication across different components of a system
- Support for flexible authentication and authorization workflows

## Installation

To use this library in your Golang project, simply import it using:

```bash
go get github.com/devmateusramos/security-communication-with-jwt
